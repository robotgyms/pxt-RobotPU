# 🚀 Mastering JavaScript on the micro:bit

Transitioning from Blocks to **Static TypeScript (STS)**—the version of JavaScript used in MakeCode—unlocks the full potential of Robot PU. This guide covers everything from the interface to advanced Object-Oriented Design.

## 1. The Programming Interface

When you open [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org), you primarily work in the **Blocks** editor. To switch to JavaScript:

1. Locate the **toggle switch** at the top center of the screen.
2. Click **JavaScript**.
3. The toolbox on the left remains, but clicking a category now provides code snippets instead of blocks.

## 2. Basic JavaScript Syntax

STS is "strongly typed," meaning it likes to know what kind of data you are using.

* **Variables**: Use `let` for values that change and `const` for values that stay the same.
```javascript
let speed = 100;
const robotName = "PU";

```


* **Functions**: Wrap reusable logic in functions.
```javascript
function waveHand() {
    pins.servoWritePin(AnalogPin.P1, 90);
    basic.pause(500);
    pins.servoWritePin(AnalogPin.P1, 0);
}

```


* **Loops**: The `basic.forever` function is a special loop that runs your code repeatedly in the background.

## 3. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

Classes allow you to group data and behaviors together. This is how we build "drivers" for sensors like the Sonar on PU's chest.

### Example: A Simple Robot Component

```javascript
class LedEye {
    pin: DigitalPin;

    constructor(targetPin: DigitalPin) {
        this.pin = targetPin;
    }

    blink() {
        pins.digitalWritePin(this.pin, 1);
        basic.pause(200);
        pins.digitalWritePin(this.pin, 0);
    }
}

// Create an "instance" of the eye on Pin P16
let leftEye = new LedEye(DigitalPin.P16);
leftEye.blink();

```

## 4. Compilation and Uploading

MakeCode compiles your JavaScript into a **.hex** file—a format the micro:bit hardware understands.

### Step-by-Step Upload:

1. **Connect**: Plug your micro:bit into your computer via USB.
2. **Download**: Click the purple **Download** button.
3. **Transfer**:
* **Direct (WebUSB)**: If your browser is paired, the code flashes instantly.
* **Manual**: Drag the `.hex` file from your Downloads folder onto the **MICROBIT** drive on your computer.


4. **Run**: The yellow light on the back flashes during the transfer. Once it stops, the program starts automatically.

## 5. Tips for Clean and Reusable Code

Writing "clean" code makes it easier for you (and others) to fix bugs later.

* **Use Descriptive Names**: Instead of `let x = 10`, use `let sonarDistance = 10`.
* **The Single Responsibility Principle**: A class or function should do **one** thing well. For example, a `Sonar` class should only handle measuring distance, not playing music.
* **Comment Your Logic**: Use `//` to explain *why* you are doing something complex.
* **Avoid "Magic Numbers"**: Instead of using `0.0171821` inside your logic, create a variable named `SOUND_SPEED_CONSTANT`.
* **Keep it Modular**: Put your classes at the top of the file or in separate tabs to keep your main `forever` loop tidy.
